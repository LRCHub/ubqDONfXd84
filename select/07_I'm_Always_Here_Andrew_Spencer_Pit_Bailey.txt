I'll be ready
Never you fear
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready (I'll be ready) (I'll be ready)
Forever and always
I'm always here
Some people stand in the darkness
Afraid to step into the light
Some people need to help somebody
When the edge of surrender's in sight.
Don't you worry!
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm always ready
I won't let you out of my sight
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I won't let you out of my sight!
In us we all have the power
But sometimes it's so hard to see
And instinct is stronger than reason
It's just human nature to me
Don't you worry!
It's gonna be alright
'Cause I'm always ready
I won't let you out of my sight
I'll be ready
Never you fear
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'll be ready
Never you fear
I'll be ready (I'll be ready) (I'll be ready)
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'll be ready (I'll be ready)
Never you fear (no don't you fear)
I'll be ready
Forever and always
I'm always here
I'm always here!
