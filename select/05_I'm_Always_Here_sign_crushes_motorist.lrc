[00:31.23] I'm breaking down
[00:38.77] Slowly
[00:47.65] I'm going to lose you
[00:54.42] 'Cause I can't be
[01:03.82] A better man
[01:09.58] Sweep you off your feet
[01:19.49] And I'll be here waiting
[01:31.49] 
[02:07.40] I'm always here, I'm always here
[02:16.13] When you need me, you know I'm here
[02:23.46] I'm always here, I'm always here
[02:31.46] I'm always going to be right here
